# DragonSitter

### Overview

DragonSitter is a simple text-based Java game where players interact with a baby dragon by performing tasks like naming the dragon, petting, feeding, playing, and giving it a bath. The player provides input through the console to take care of the dragon, ensuring each task is completed before the dragon can go to bed. This project was a first step in learning Java and exploring programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input validation.

### Features

- Allows the player to name the dragon with validation (no spaces or non-alphabetical characters).
- Simulates interactive tasks with the dragon (pet, feed, play, bath).
- Ensures all tasks are completed before the dragon can go to bed.
- Provides feedback based on the player's interactions with the dragon.
- Uses loops and conditionals to control the flow of the game.

### Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later recommended).
- An IDE such as Eclipse (optional) or a command-line interface to compile and run Java programs.
- No external dependencies—this project uses only Java's built-in libraries.

### Expected Output
- The program will prompt the user to name the dragon and ensure the name is valid (no spaces or non-letter characters).
- The player can interact with the dragon by choosing from the following options: pet, feed, play, and bath.
- After all interactions are completed, the player will be instructed to tell the dragon to go to bed.
- If the player attempts to send the dragon to bed before completing all tasks, the game will remind them to finish first.
- When the dragon goes to bed, the game ends with a thank-you message.

### Personal Experience & Challenges

This project marked my first experience with Java, and it was an exciting journey! I challenged myself by implementing features I hadn’t learned yet, like user input validation and controlling the game flow with loops and conditionals. While the code is messy by my current standards, it remains a significant milestone that helped me fall in love with coding.

Some of my favorite parts of the project were:
- Implementing input validation to ensure a valid dragon name.
- Using a loop to allow multiple interactions until all tasks were completed.
- Implementing conditional logic to ensure proper sequence and flow of the game.

Despite the challenges I faced, I'm proud of this first project and how much I learned along the way!

#### Future Enhancements

- Add additional dragon interactions (e.g., teaching the dragon tricks).
- Implement a scoring or reward system based on how well the player takes care of the dragon.
- Add an option to customize the dragon's appearance or behavior.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve the game experience.
